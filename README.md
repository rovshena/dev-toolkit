# Uses

List of all the tools I use in my daily workflow.

## Office Setup

- **Lenovo Yoga 510-14IKB:** 14.00-inch display that has a resolution of 1366x768 pixels. It is powered by a Core i5 7th Gen processor.
- **Delux M320BU USB Optical Mouse:** The Delux M320BU is a really handy computer mouse. It has a special sensor that makes it super good at moving around on your desk, so you can use it easily.

## Development

- **PHPStorm:** Get straight to coding without having to install and configure lots of plugins. PhpStorm includes everything you need for PHP, JavaScript, and TypeScript development, as well as database support.
- **Firefox:** I'd like to give Chrome another shot one day but for now using Firefox for both development and general browsing.
- **Cmder:** Cmder is a software package created out of pure frustration over the absence of nice console emulators on Windows.

## Team Workflow

- **Gitlab Issues:** Use issues to collaborate on ideas, solve problems, and plan work. Share and discuss proposals with your team and with outside collaborators.
- **Linear:** Cycles focus your team on what work should happen next. A healthy routine to maintain velocity and make meaningful progress.

## Writing

- **Grammarly:** Work with an AI writing partner that helps you find the words you need to write that tricky email, to get your point across, to keep your work moving.
