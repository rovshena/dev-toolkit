# Dev Toolkit

Welcome to **Dev Toolkit**! This is my personal collection of tools, software, and resources that I use daily to get
work done. It's here to help me set up and maintain a productive development environment.

## Office Setup

- **Lenovo Yoga 510-14IKB**\
  I use the Lenovo Yoga 510-14IKB, which has a 14.00-inch display with a resolution of 1366x768 pixels. It’s powered by
  a Core i5 7th Gen processor and gives me the performance I need for coding, multitasking, and even a bit of
  entertainment. The 2-in-1 design lets me switch between laptop and tablet modes whenever I need more flexibility.

- **Logitech M185**\
  The Logitech M185 wireless mouse is my go-to for its compact and comfortable design. It’s reliable and works perfectly
  for long work sessions without causing any hand strain. Plus, the plug-and-play setup makes it super easy to use
  wherever I’m working.

## Development

- **PHPStorm**\
  PHPStorm is my IDE of choice because it’s ready to go right out of the box. I don’t have to spend time installing or
  configuring plugins, and it supports PHP, JavaScript, TypeScript, and even database management. It’s fast, smart, and
  helps me write better code with less hassle.

- **Google Chrome**\
  Chrome is my main browser, and I love it for its speed and reliability. Its developer tools and huge library of
  extensions make debugging and testing much easier. And since everything syncs across my devices, I can pick up right
  where I left off.

- **Firefox**\
  Firefox is my backup browser, but it’s far from second-best. I often use it for testing or when I need to focus on
  privacy. Its developer tools are excellent, especially for working with CSS Grid and Flexbox, and it’s a great
  addition to my workflow.

- **Franz**\
  Franz keeps all my messaging apps in one place, which is a lifesaver. Whether it’s Slack, WhatsApp, or something else,
  I can manage them all from one interface. It’s simple, organized, and keeps me on top of both work and personal
  messages.

- **Cmder**\
  Cmder is my terminal emulator of choice on Windows. It’s portable, good-looking, and brings Unix commands to Windows,
  which is a big deal for me. It’s efficient, easy to use, and makes command-line work so much better.

## Team Workflow

- **GitLab Issues**\
  GitLab Issues is the tool I use for tracking ideas, tasks, and progress. It’s a great way to collaborate with
  teammates and stay organized. I like how easy it is to integrate discussions, milestones, and outside collaborators
  into one workflow.

- **Linear**\
  Linear helps me keep my team focused and moving forward. The "Cycles" feature is awesome for prioritizing what we need
  to work on next. It’s clean, fast, and helps us make meaningful progress without feeling overwhelmed.

## Writing

- **Grammarly**\
  Grammarly is my secret weapon for writing emails, documents, and everything in between. It catches my typos, suggests
  better ways to phrase things, and even helps me match the tone I’m going for. It’s like having a writing coach that’s
  always there when I need it.
