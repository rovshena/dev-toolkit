## Non-Development Software

The first step when setting up a new computer is to update the operating system to ensure it has the latest features and
security patches. Once updated, I proceed to install essential non-development tools, such as utilities and productivity
software, to establish a solid base environment.

**Here are the tools:**

* **Google Chrome:** My primary browser, used as the foundation for browsing and web-based tasks.
* **Firefox:** My backup browser, used for secondary or testing purposes.
* **Franz:** It serves as a central repository for all my messages from various services.
* **Alfred:** It enhances your productivity through the use of hotkeys, keywords, text expansion, and additional
  features.
